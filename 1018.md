  >
- Discoverability

  Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?
  >

- Understanding

  What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?

>"Most of the problems come from a complete lack of understanding of the design principles necessary for effective human-machine interaction."
>The engineers are well trainning;therefore, most of users are not the same.

>"Design presents a fascinating interplay of technology and psychology, that the designers must understand both."

>To design the product must consider: **People will make errors**. In the class of Ergonomics,Pro. Huang taught .Here is same means.

>"The solution is human-centered design (HCD), an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving.

>

>Recalling of Ergonomics, most of the researchs base on measure capabilities, likes: Biomechanics(physical), visual, auditory....


>Good design starts with an understanding of psychology and technology. Good design requires good communication, especially from machine to person, indicating what actions are possible,what is happening, and what is about to happen. "

>**"Fit the machine to people"** conclude previous paragraph
