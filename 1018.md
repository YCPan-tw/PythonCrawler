## Top of good design
  >
- Discoverability

  Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?
  >

- Understanding

  What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?

>"Most of the problems come from a complete lack of understanding of the design principles necessary for effective human-machine interaction."
>The engineers are well trainning;therefore, most of users are not the same.

>"Design presents a fascinating interplay of technology and psychology, that the designers must understand both."

>To design the product must consider: **People will make errors**. In the class of Ergonomics,Pro. Huang taught .Here is same means.

>"The solution is human-centered design (HCD), an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving.

>

>Recalling of Ergonomics, most of the researchs base on measure capabilities, likes: Biomechanics(physical), visual, auditory....


>Good design starts with an understanding of psychology and technology. Good design requires good communication, especially from machine to person, indicating what actions are possible,what is happening, and what is about to happen. "

>**"Fit the machine to people"** conclude previous paragraph

## Fundamental Principles of Interaction
Experience: This is an ambigous word, example: automobile.
  > "Fit and finish, the sensation of power during acceleration, their ease of control while shifting or steering, or the wonderful feel of the knobs and switches on the instrument. Those are experiences."
### Discoverability
We use the product or service means interacting with them.Next, how its functions, operations, these take out the thought about **Discoverability**
six principle to understand discoverability:
- affordances
- signifiers
- constraints
- mappings
- feedback
- conceptual model

### 1.Affordances
Can be define as combination of relation between user and product.
>Example: chair's function is support, and moved by single human(most).glass is invisibility, but sometimes need to notify their existence.

> "Gibsonian pointed out that all the senses work together, that we pick up information about the world by the combined result of all of them. “Information pickup” .sight, sound,smell, touch, balance, kinesthetic, acceleration, body position

 Moreover, the physical objects conveyed important information about how people could interact with them, a property he named **"affordance"**.

Visible affordance provide the clues the operate product.
>Example: A flat plate mounted on a door affords pushing. Knobs afford turning, pushing, and pulling.

### 2. signifiers
We discuss affordance at previous part, also found relation between product and human would not always clear. Signifiers will provide solution to it.

>Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. We need both.

Signifiers are not subtituted affordance.They can be work together or fusion.

### 3. mappings

>Mapping is an important concept in the design and layout of controls and displays. When the mapping uses spatial correspondence between the layout of the controls and the devices being controlled.

Mapping concept is similar to Ergonomics compatability.The range define mappings are larger than compability.
